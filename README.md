# Semester Project

## School Assignment Manager

This project will make it possible for students to track and manage coursework throughout multiple courses. Students can add different assignment types (homework, readings, quizzes, exams, etc.) with corresponding due dates and update its completion status. 

These attributes allow for accessing assignments for a specific class, sorting all assignments by due date, filtering by assignment type, and track task/assignment completion.
